## Code Examples

The following applications are provided to demonstrate the typical or interesting usage models of one or more peripheral libraries.

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [I2C driver asynchronous - I2C EEPROM](apps/driver/i2c/async/i2c_eeprom/readme.md) | This example application shows how to use the I2C driver in asynchronous mode to perform operations on the EEPROM |
| [SPI Driver asynchronous - Self loopback multi client](apps/driver/spi/async/spi_self_loopback_multi_client/readme.md) | This example demonstrates how to use the SPI driver in asynchronous mode to achieve self-loop back between multiple clients |
| [USART driver asynchronous - USART echo](apps/driver/usart/async/usart_echo/readme.md) | This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in asynchronous mode |
| [USART driver synchronous - USART echo](apps/driver/usart/sync/usart_echo/readme.md) | This example echoes the received characters over the console using the USART driver in synchronous mode |
| [FAT filesystem using NVM Media](apps/fs/nvm_fat/readme.md) | This application shows an example of implementing a FAT disk in the device internal Flash memory |
| [FreeRTOS basic](apps/rtos/freertos/basic_freertos/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates context switching between four tasks of different priorites. Two tasks run periodically while the other two tasks are event driven |
| [Console Debug System Service using UART](apps/system/console_debug/sys_console_debug_uart_read_write/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates the UART based console and debug system service |
| [Time System Service multi-client](apps/system/time/sys_time_multiclient/readme.md) | This example application demonstrates the multi-client system timer functionality |
